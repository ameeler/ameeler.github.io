                                Music has been a large part of my life since I was 14 years old. I saw one of my best friends playing drums and I knew in that moment I was going to do the same.
                                I am a self-taught musician and play drums, bass, guitar, piano, and ukulele. I now live with and go to school with that one best friend (Zach Russell) where we are beginnning to
                                make a name for ouselves in Austin's live music scene. That name is: Yardsale!
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                Yardsale was formed in August 2021 by Nathaniel Ogren (Lead Vocals and Guitar), Zach Russell (Bass), Christian Daniel (Lead Guitar), Patrick Wang (Keyboard), and I (drums).
                                We found each other through our attendance at UT Austin and became very close friends. Nathaniel had been writing music since he was a small child and just released an amazing 
                                song called "Japanese Motorbike." The rest of us were very impressed by this single and skilled at our own instruments, so we decided to join forces and start a band.
                              </p>

                              <h2>The band begins!</h2>
                              <p>
                                We started out playing at a small coffee shop in east Austin called Halcyon. There, only our close friends watched us as we treated that
                                coffee shop like Madison Square Garden. I know for sure that no one has ever experienced sound so loud in such a small space. Shortly after that,
                                we released our first indie-rock single as a band: Stranger. To support the release, we decided to host our own live show in someones backyard.
                                We advertised it for weeks with zero clue on how it would turn out. To our surprise, over a hundred people showed up to watch us 
                                and make us feel like we were the biggest rockstars on the planet.
                              </p>
                              
                              <h2>Things start to heat up.</h2>
                              <p>
                                In the next 6 months, we released 4 more singles and played at larger and larger venues. We got an offer from The Ballroom for our
                                first headlining show on Feburary 24th. We brought out a trumpet player and played with two very amazing bands: Sneaky Peaches and the Fuzz and Rococo Disco.
                                We were able to sell around 150 tickets to our show and had the night of our lives. Not long after that, we won a battle of the bands competition
                                at UT and got the amazing opportunity to open for the famous indie-pop band, COIN, at UT's Forty Acres Festival.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                Forty Acres Festival was the most fun I have ever had in my life. We played to probably around 800 people on a huge stage 
                                in front of the UT Tower. The craziest thing was that people enjoyed watching us. I got to sit on that stage, play my heart out on my drums,
                                and make people smile. I will never forget that, because it reminded me of why I enjoy music so much. I actually made peoples' day 
                                and that is the biggest honor I could ever have. 
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                Currently we have around 1,000 monthly listeners and over 20,000 streams on Spotify. It is amazing that we get to connect with that many people 
                                and share our stories with them. It brings me joy to make people feel good with our music, and I would like to continue doing that for 
                                as long as I can! You can find the links to our Spotify and Instagram in the webpage header.
